# Projects

Here will be the repository for my projects.

I am building a portfolio of projects to show knowledge in control theory and robotics.

I have an inverse pendulum project to show knowledge in control theory. 
I also have a project where I use ROS to get a turtlebot out of a maze.
A more indepth project using linear controls for a non-linear system.
Lastly there is a machine vision project showing a SCARRA-like manipuator picking up a nut and bringing it back to the start point of the manupulator.
