# Projects

Here will be the repository for my projects.

I am building a portfolio of projects to show knowledge in control theory and robotics. 

I have an inverted pendulum project to show knowledge in control theory. I have modeled the inverted penudlum and linearized it to provide control so that it will balance to a theta of pi and an arbitrary x position.

I also have a project where I use ROS to get a turtlebot out of a maze. I use different sensors in the program to determine position and see if I escape the maze.

A more indepth project using linear controls for a non-linear system. This models a AFM microscope as a spring mass damper system. I also linearize the system but I show that the non-linear system is stable and controllable. 

Lastly there is a machine vision project showing a SCARRA-like manipuator picking up a nut and bringing it back to the start point of the manupulator. I use OpenCV in my python code to get the position which I send to the PSoC to control the manipulator. There is a video and picture of what I did.

There is much more to do!
